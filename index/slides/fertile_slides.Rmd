## Introduction

`fertile`:
  - **What?** `R` package started by Prof. Ben Baumer
  - **Goal:** Improve reproducibility in R
  - **My Role:** Leading code development for the last ~2 years!
  - **This Year:** Advanced features, getting product ready for public use, and experimental testing.

## Overview

1. What is reproducibility and why is it lacking?
2. Other attempts to address reproducibility and their shortcomings
3. Why `fertile` is different
4. How `fertile` works
5. Potential applications and Smith College experiment
6. Conclusion
7. Accessing project materials

## What is reproducibility?

> In data science, research is considered fully __reproducible__ when the requisite code and data files produce identical results when run by another analyst.


.center[VS]

> __Replicability__: The ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a study when following the original procedure but collecting new data


---
## The benefits of reproducibility

1. Trusting findings

2. Receiving feedback

3. Extending ideas

---
## The reproducibility crisis

*Nature (2016)*: 52% respondents claim "crisis"

Vast majority cannot reproduce others' work. 

Half cannot even reproduce their own!

Some fields have reproducibility rate <10%.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("nature-1.jpeg")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("nature-2.png")
```

## The six major components of reproducibility


1. Basic project components made accessible to the public:

- Data (raw and/or processed)

- Metadata

- Code

- Related Software

2. Well-organized file structure:

- Separate folders for different file types

- No extraneous files

- Minimal clutter

3. The project is documented well:

- Files are clearly named / ordered

- A README is present

- Code contains comments

- Software dependencies are noted

4. Good file paths:

- No absolute paths

- No paths leading outside of a project’s directory

- Only relative paths within directory

5. Randomness is accounted for:

- If used, seed must be set

6. Code is readable and consistently styled:

- Coherent style
- Follow guide (e.g. `tidyverse`)


---
## Attempts to address reproducibility: journals

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("stats-journals.png")
```
- Even if you have a reproducibility statement that does not mean that all the articles are reproducible!! 

---
## Attempts to address reproducibility: journals

### TOP Factor

- Helps measure state of academic reproducibility on the whole
- Score range: 0-30
- Approx 50% of journals = 5 or below
- Only 5% score > 15

---
## Attempts to address reproducibility: educational programs

- Replication studies at Graduate level (Cambridge, Harvard, UNC, Penn State, Berkeley)
- At undergraduate level, requirement for work to be completed in `.Rmd` (Smith, Duke)

---
## Attempts to address reproducibility: software

- `rrtools`: create basic package structure, Docker dependency management
- `orderly`: automation of projects
- `workflowr`: version control
- `checkers`: custom checks to assess reproducibility
- `renv` (formerly `packrat`): dependency management
- `drake`: makefiles
- `reproducible`: caching to speed up analysis


- Continuous integration tools: `wercker`, `GitHub Actions`, `Travis CI`, `Circle CI`.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('ci-tools.png')
```


---
## Shortcomings of current attempts

- Journals:

    1. Authors lack knowledge and/or time to make changes
    2. Reproducibility review is time/cost intensive for journals

- Education:

    1. Workshops often optional
    2. Only really at graduate level
    3. Takes time away from other important class topics
    4. Takes a lot of effort for professor to set up

- Software:

    1. Packages narrow in scope
    2. Complex functions, bad for new users
    3. Cumbersome, with steep learning curve
    4. CI tools: lack software-specific tools 

---
## Setting `fertile` apart: package goals

1) Be simple, with a small library of functions/tools that are straightforward to use.

2) Be accessible to a variety of users, with a relatively small learning curve.

3) Be able to address a wide variety of aspects of reproducibility, rather than just
one or two key issues.

4) Have features specific to a particular coding language that can address that
language’s unique challenges.

5) Be customizable, allowing users to choose for themselves which aspects of
reproducibility they want to focus on.

6) Be educational, teaching those that use it about why their projects are not
reproducible and how to correct that in the future.

7) Be applicable to a wide variety of domains.
