## Introduction

`fertile`:
  - **What?** `R` package started by Prof. Ben Baumer
  - **Goal:** Improve reproducibility in R
  - **My Role:** Leading code development for the last ~2 years!
  - **This Year:** Advanced features, getting product ready for public use, and experimental testing.

## Overview

1. What is reproducibility and why is it lacking?
2. Other attempts to address reproducibility and their shortcomings
3. Why `fertile` is different
4. How `fertile` works
5. Potential applications and Smith College experiment
6. Conclusion
7. Accessing project materials

## What is reproducibility?

> In data science, research is considered fully __reproducible__ when the requisite code and data files produce identical results when run by another analyst.


.center[VS]

> __Replicability__: The ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a study when following the original procedure but collecting new data


---
## The benefits of reproducibility

1. Trusting findings

2. Receiving feedback

3. Extending ideas

---
## The reproducibility crisis

*Nature (2016)*: 52% respondents claim "crisis"

Vast majority cannot reproduce others' work. 

Half cannot even reproduce their own!

Some fields have reproducibility rate <10%.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("nature-1.jpeg")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("nature-2.png")
```

## The six major components of reproducibility


1. Basic project components made accessible to the public:

- Data (raw and/or processed)

- Metadata

- Code

- Related Software

2. Well-organized file structure:

- Separate folders for different file types

- No extraneous files

- Minimal clutter

3. The project is documented well:

- Files are clearly named / ordered

- A README is present

- Code contains comments

- Software dependencies are noted

4. Good file paths:

- No absolute paths

- No paths leading outside of a project’s directory

- Only relative paths within directory

5. Randomness is accounted for:

- If used, seed must be set

6. Code is readable and consistently styled:

- Coherent style
- Follow guide (e.g. `tidyverse`)
