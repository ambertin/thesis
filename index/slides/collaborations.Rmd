## Introduction

`fertile`:
  - **What?** Software package written in `R`
  - **Goal:** Improve scientific reproducibility of `R` projects
  - **My Role:** Leading code development for the last ~2 years!
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height=270, out.width=250}
knitr::include_graphics("fertile-hex.png")
```

## Overview

1. What is reproducibility and why is it lacking?
2. Other attempts to address reproducibility and their shortcomings
3. Why `fertile` is different
4. Potential applications
5. Conclusion
6. Accessing project materials

---
## What is reproducibility?

> In data science, research is considered fully __reproducible__ when the requisite code and data files produce identical results when run by another analyst.


---
## The benefits of reproducibility

1. Trusting findings

2. Receiving feedback

3. Extending ideas

---
## The reproducibility crisis

*Nature (2016)*: 52% respondents claim "crisis"

Vast majority cannot reproduce others' work. 

Half cannot even reproduce their own!

Some fields have reproducibility rate <10%.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("nature-1.jpeg")
```

---

## 6 components of reproducibility

1) Basic files made accessible

2) Organized file structure

3) Good documentation

4) File paths

5) Randomness

6) Style

```{r badge-graphics, out.width="15%",  fig.show='hold', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("structure-badge.png", "tidy-badge.png", "documentation-badge.png", "paths-badge.png", "randomness-badge.png", "style-badge.png"))
```


---
## Attempts to address reproducibility

* Educational institutions: replication studies (grad), and reproducible formats (undergrad)

* Journals: requirements for submitting authors to make code, data, and sometimes additional things available

* Software: `R` packages with tools to help users improve reproducibility, continuous integration tools (`wercker`, `GitHub Actions`, `Travis CI`, `Circle CI`)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('ci-tools.png')
```

---
## Shortcomings of current attempts

- Education:

    1. Only really at graduate level
    2. Takes time away from other important class topics

- Journals:

    1. Inconsistent
    2. Only 1 component
    3. Poor enforcement (authors lack knowledge and/or time to make changes and reproducibility review is time/cost intensive for journals)

- Software:

    1. Packages narrow in scope
    2. Complex functions, bad for new users
    3. CI tools: lack software-specific tools

## Setting `fertile` apart: package goals

1) Simple and straightforward

2) Accessible to variety of users

3) Addresses many aspects of reproducibility

4) R-specific features

5) Customizable

6) Educational

7) Applicable in many domains

## Addressing the 6 components

.small[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('components-summary.png')
```
]

--- 

## Overview functions

- `proj_check()`: run a bunch of different tests on various parts of reproducibility (files, paths, documentation, etc.)

- `proj_badges()`: earn/display badges for different components, summary of project generation info

```{r badge-logos, out.width="15%",  fig.show='hold', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("structure-badge.png", "tidy-badge.png", "documentation-badge.png", "paths-badge.png", "randomness-badge.png", "style-badge.png"))
```
---
## Overview functions

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('badges-1.png')
```

---
## Educational features

- Interactive path warning system

- Checks provide informative messages
  - Explain problem
  - Provide solution

.small[
```{r, error=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
read.csv("~/Desktop/my_data.csv")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
error_msg <- "Error: Detected absolute paths. Absolute paths are not reproducible and will likely only work on your computer. If you would like to continue anyway, please execute the following command: utils::read.csv('~/Desktop/my_data.csv')"

cat(stringr::str_wrap(error_msg, width = 70))
```
]

---
## Potential applications

- Speed up journal review --> more journals w/ reproducibility requirements
- Use `proj_badges()` for submitting authors

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("journal-process-2.png")
```


---
## Potential applications

- Introduce reproducibility in more undergrad classrooms

- Limited barriers to entry:
1. R and RStudio installed on their computer
2. Knowledge of how to install a package from GitHub and load it into their
environment
3. Knowledge of how to create an R project
4. Knowledge of how to run basic functions and input simple file paths

---
## Conclusion

- Current reproducibility crisis, solutions inadequate

- `fertile` fills gaps!
  
- More and more people starting to use it...

- But just helping one person is enough!

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("oprah.jpg")
