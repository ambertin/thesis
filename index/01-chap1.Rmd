# An Introduction to Reproducibility {#reproducibility}

## What is reproducibility?

In the field of data science, research is considered fully *reproducible* when the requisite code and data files produce identical results when run by another analyst. 

Reproducible research has a wide variety of benefits in the scientific community. When researchers provide the code and data used for their work in a well-organized and reproducible format, readers are more easily able to determine the veracity of any findings by following the steps from raw data to conclusions. The creators of reproducible research can also more easily receive more specific feedback (including bug fixes) on their work. Moreover, others interested in the research topic can use the code to apply the methods and ideas used in one project to their own work with minimal effort.

Although often confused, the concept of *reproducibility* is distinct from the similar idea of *replicability*: the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a study when following the original procedure but collecting new data. Replicability has larger-scale implications than reproducibilty; the findings of research studies can not be accepted unless a variety of other researchers come to the same conclusions through independent work.

Reproducibility and replicability are both necessary to the advancement of scientific research, but they vary significantly in terms of their difficulty to achieve. Reproducibility, in theory, is somewhat simple to attain in data analyses--because code is inherently non-random (excepting applications involving random number generation) and data remain consistent, variability is highly restricted. The achievement of replicability, on the other hand, is a much more complex challenge, involving significantly more variablility and requiring high quality data, effective study design, and incredibly robust hypotheses.


## The Reproducibility Crisis

Despite the relative simplicity of the reproducibility problem, the scientific community has been unable to solve it. 52% of respondents in a 2016 Nature survey believed that science was going through a "crisis" of reproducibility. https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970 Other studies paint an even bleaker picture: a 2015 study found that over 50% of studies psychology failed reproducibility tests and research from 2012 found that figure closer to 90% in the field of cancer biology. (https://www.nature.com/news/over-half-of-psychology-studies-fail-reproducibility-test-1.18248, https://www.nature.com/articles/483531a)

Without reproducibility, the scientific community cannot properly verify study results. This makes it difficult to identify which information should be believed and which should not and increases the likelihood that studies sharing misleading information will be dispersed.  




## A Brief History of Reproducibility

In recent years, reproducibility has moved to the forefront of scientific discussion. The rise of data-driven technologies, alongside our newly founded ability to instantly share knowledge worldwide, has made reproducibility increasingly critical to the advancement of scientific understanding.  Academics have recognized this, and publications on the topic appear to have increased siginficantly in the last several years (@eisner-reproducibility; @sep-scientific-reproducibility; @bioessays-gosselin; @engineering-reproducibility; @plos-biology).

However, peproducibility has not always been at the forefront of scientific discussion.

## The Components of Reproducible Research

### Literature

Publications on reproducibility can be found in all areas of scientific research. However, as @Goodman341ps12 argue, the language and conceptual framework of research reproducibility varies significantly across the sciences, and there are no clear standards on reproducibility agreed upon by the scientific community as a whole. We consider recommendations from a variety of fields and determine the key aspects of reproducibility faced by scientists in different disciplines. 

@kitzes2017practice present a collection of case studies on reproducibility practices from across the data-intensive sciences, illustrating a variety of recommendations and techniques for achieving reproducibility. Although their work does not come to a consensus on the exact standards of reproducibility that should be followed, several common trends and principles emerge from their case studies: 1) use clear separation, labeling, and documentation, 2) automate processes when possible, and 3) design the data analysis workflow as a sequence of small steps glued together, with outputs from one step serving as inputs into the next. This is a common suggestion within the computing community, originating as part of the Unix philosophy (@unix).

@cooper2017guide focus on data analysis in `R` and identify a similar list of important reproducibility components, reinforcing the need for clearly labeled, well-documented, and well-separated files. In addition, they recommend publishing a list of dependencies and using version control. 
@broman reiterates the need for clear naming and file separation while sharing several additional suggestions: keep the project contained in one directory, use relative paths, and include a `README`.

The reproducibility recommendations from R OpenSci, a non-profit initiative founded in 2011 to make scientific data retrieval reproducible, share similar principles to those discussed previously. They focus on a need for a well-developed file system, with no extraneous files and clear labeling. They also reiterate the need to note dependencies and use automation when possible, while making clear a suggestion not present in the previously-discussed literature: the need to use seeds, which allow for the saving and restoring of the random number generator state, when running code involving randomness (@r-opensci).

When considered in combination, these sources provide a well-rounded picture of the components important to research reproducibility. Using this literature as a guideline, we identify several key features of reproducible work. These recommendations are a matter of opinion---due to the lack of agreement on which components of reproducibility are most important, we select those that are mentioned most often, as well as some that are mentioned less but that we view as important. 


1. A well-designed file structure:

  - Separate folders for different file types.
  - No extraneous files.
  - Minimal clutter.

2. Good documentation:

  - Files are clearly named, preferably in a way where the order in which they should be run is clear.
  - A README is present.
  - Dependencies are noted.

3. Reproducible file paths:

  - No absolute paths, or paths leading to locations outside of a project's directory, are used in code---only portable (relative) paths.

4. Randomness is accounted for:

  - If randomness is used in code, a seed must also be set.

5. Readable, styled code:

  - Code should be written in a coherent style. Code that conforms to a style guide or is written in a consistent dialect is easier to read (@hermans2017programming). We believe that the `tidyverse` provides the most accessible dialect of `R`.


Much of the available literature focuses on file structure, organization, and naming, and `fertile`'s features are consistent with this. @marwick2018packaging} provide the framework for file structure that `fertile` is based on: a structure similar to that of an `R` package (@coreteam-extensions, @hadley-packages), with an `R` folder, as well as `data`, `data-raw`, `inst`, and `vignettes`.
