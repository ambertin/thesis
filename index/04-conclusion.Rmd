# Conclusion {-}

`fertile` is an `R` package that lowers barriers to reproducible data analysis projects in `R`, providing a wide array of checks and suggestions addressing many different aspects of project reproducibility, including file organization, file path usage, documentation, and dependencies.
`fertile` is meant to be educational, providing informative error messages that indicate why users' mistakes are problematic and sharing recommendations on how to fix them. The package is designed in this way so as to promote a greater understanding of reproducibility concepts in its users, with the goal of increasing the overall awareness and understanding of reproducibility in the `R` community.

The package has very low barriers to entry, making it accessible to users with various levels of background knowledge. Unlike many other `R` packages focused on reproducibility that are currently available, the features of `fertile` can be accessed almost effortlessly. Many of the retroactive features can be accessed in only two lines of code requiring minimal arguments and some of the proactive features can be accessed with no additional effort beyond loading the package. This, in combination with the fact that `fertile` does not focus on one specific area of reproducibility, instead covering (albeit in less detail) a wide variety of topics, means that `fertile` makes it easy for data analysts of all skill levels to quickly gain a better understanding of the reproducibility of the work.

In the moment, it often feels easiest to take a shortcut---to use an absolute path or change a working directory. However, when considering the long term path of a project, spending the extra time to improve reproducibility is worthwhile. `fertile`'s user-friendly features can help data analysts avoid these harmful shortcuts with minimal effort.
