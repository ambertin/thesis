abstract: |
  Data science research is considered *reproducible* when the associated code and data files produce identical results when run by another analyst. Although reproducibility is a key component in the advancement of scientific knowledge, a significant proportion of research articles and other analyses fail to meet reproducibility standards. Steps have been taken to address this issue, including academic courses on reproducibility, additional requirements or recommendations for journal article acceptance, and a variety of software tools. However, many of these are challenging to use, are too generalized, or are not accessible to a wide audience. In this thesis, I present my work on developing `fertile`, an `R` package designed to help improve the reproducibility of `R Projects` and address the limitations of other solutions by being 1) simple to use, 2) easily accessible, 2) broad in scope, 3) tailored to the specific challenges faced by R users, 4) customizable, and 5) educational. Chapter 1 considers the background information motivating `fertile`, including explanation of reproducibility, its issues, current solutions, and their limitations. Chapter 2 is code-focused, demonstrating the functions available in `fertile` to address different aspects of reproducibility and delving into some of the details of how the software works. Finally, Chapter 3 considers `fertile`'s potential applications in the real world, including an in-depth analysis of an experiment involving `fertile`'s integration into an introductory data science course at Smith College.

If it weren't for Professor Ben Baumer, I would not be here writing this thesis today. The Introduction to Data Science course I took with him in my first semester at Smith College spurred on my love for the field, prompting me to declare a major---with Ben as my adviser---soon after. 

That course---SDS 192---was my first introduction to the topic of scientific reproducibility. In Ben's class, one of the first undergraduate courses in the country to implement reproducibility as part of the curriculum (@baumer2014r), I was introduced to a variety of tools that could help make my work more reproducible. I learned how to write effective narrative reports with RMarkdown, how to implement version control on GitHub, how to write well-styled code, and how to use R projects to structure my files in a way that was easy to manage. 

Through this work, I began to see the benefits of emphasizing a reproducible workflow. When I worked on projects with other students, the tools I learned in class enabled us to collaborate with one another easily and keep track of the progress we had made. And when I tried to look back at my own work from the past, my attention to reproducibility meant that it was much easier for me to re-compute and understand what I had done previously.

Additionally, my work in Introduction to Data Science helped build a strong interest in R. I developed a love for programming in the language and was curious to learn more about how it worked---both behind the scenes and practice. This interest prompted me to pursue research in the field. I wanted to expand my knowledge and challenge myself by learning about and solving cutting-edge issues in the data science domain. 


As soon as I felt that I had built up enough coding experience to be able to tackle challenging issues, I reached out to the data science faculty to see if there were any opportunities. Ben enthusiastically welcomed me in, telling me that he had recently started developing an R package focused on reproducibility and offering me a position assisting him with writing it. That was when I first learned about `fertile`. 

As part of his interest in reproducibility, Ben had been working---with help from Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan of RStudio---to develop a package designed to help users create optimal conditions for reproducible work in R (titled "fertile").  

When it was presented to me, the package was incomplete. Several of the major functions that exist now were there at the time, but there were not many features beyond the basics. Additionally, several functions were not fully written or were throwing errors, the package had little to no documentation, and the majority of tests that had been written to test the functions were failing.

I was given the opportunity to join the project and help move `fertile` to a functional state: to fix the errors that were present, document the package, and write new functions to expand the operation beyond the barebones structure that was present.
  
The `fertile` project was an excellent fit for me. The package was not yet in a functional state, but had an excellent base of code to work off of. Given that it already had some basic functions and a strong structure, `fertile` provided a perfect opportunity for me to learn about the process of writing R packages. 

The more I worked on `fertile`, the more interested in the project I became. The package was unlike anything else I had been exposed to in data science. Most of my course work had been in the form of front-end coding: conducting data analyses and visualizing information. `fertile` is nothing like that. It operates completely behind the scenes, conducting a kind of meta-analysis to determine the reproducibility of a data science project. Rather than writing code to analyze data, I had to learn how to write code to analyze code that *other people* wrote to analyze data. 

This was a complex problem. It involved capturing information about the user's file system and their RStudio environment, both of which I knew nothing about. It also involved tracking and recording user behavior---something definitely not taught in data analysis courses. Even experienced R users deemed some of the goals associated with the package to be lofty. On the question of whether it was possible to test whether R code contained uncontrolled randomness, one coder said it was "probably impossible", while another said there was "fundamentally no way" to achieve it (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43638773/comprehensive-way-to-check-for-functions-that-use-the-random-number-generator-in).

The challenge of the problems at hand, however, was what made them interesting. Most of the time, there was no way to use my past coding knowledge to solve them---rather, I had to research and test out new solutions. While the process was at times frustrating, particularly given that some of the errors I came across had likely never been seen by any other R user, it was an incredible learning opportunity. I was exposed to a wide variety of R features I would likely have never seen otherwise and greatly broadened my problem-solving and troubleshooting skills. 

Every problem I solved made me more confident in my abilities and more excited to work on the `fertile`. I delved more into the topic of reproducibility and looked at some of the work by other researchers and code developers. This research introduced me to new aspects of reproducibility I wanted to include in the package and inspired me to expand its scope. 

This thesis is the culmination of the work I have been doing with `fertile` for the past two years.
