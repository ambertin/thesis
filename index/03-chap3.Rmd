# Incorporating `fertile` Into The Greater Data Science Community {#applications}

Finding a solution to addressing reproducibility on a widespread scale is a challenging problem. Attempts to do so--in academic publishing, software, and data science education--have made some progress, but many solutions have significant flaws. Primarily, they either:

A) Only address one small aspect of reproducibility--for example, software that focuses on version control or a set of journal guidelines requesting only that code and data be provided, but giving no further detail. 

\begin{center}
OR
\end{center}

B) Are challenging, time consuming, and/or burdensome to implement--for example, extensive journal guidelines, complex software packages with confusing functions, or academic courses on reproducibility that are only accessible to masters' students and take time away from other topics.

`fertile` is an attempt to address reproducibility in a way that does not fall victim to either of these challenges. Rather than focus on one area of expertise, `fertile` contains features focused on each of the six major components of reproducibility. Its self-contained nature allows users to address all aspects of reproducibility in one package; users can achieve near- or complete reproducibility with just a single piece of software. 

`fertile` also makes the processes of both achieving *and* checking reproducibility simple and fast. Those looking to check whether a project is reproducible can almost instantaneously receive a full report of where the project succeeds and where it fails, and those looking to improve their reproducibility can receive and act on `fertile`'s clear suggestions with minimal effort. Some of the package's features are enabled automatically and most others can be accessed with only a handful of functions, all of which are very simple in function. 

Additionally, `fertile` does not just provide a report on reproducibility and leave it at that. Instead, it attempts to teach its users the concepts of reproducibility in the same way that reproducibility-focused classes are meant to do. Users receive instant feedback when making mistakes and, when checking work after writing it, receive reports clearly indicating where issues were found, why they occurred, and how to correct them. 

It is also highly customizable, allowing users to utilize the tool in the way that fits their needs best. Those who want to focus their reproducibility checking in a certain direction have that option and those who want widespread overviews can also have their needs meet. Users who are interested in going beyond the base functionality of `proj_analyze` and `proj_check` also have additional functions at their disposal that they can use to check reproducibility, file paths, file types, etc.


## Potential Applications of `fertile`

These features make `fertile` an excellent tool for addressing the issue of scientific reproducibility on a widespread scale. `fertile` can provide a variety of benefits to users in all different application domains and with all different experiences. In this chapter, we consider the many potential uses of the package.

### In Journal Review

As discussed in Chapter 1, Academic journals have a significant reproducibility problem. In an attempt to address this, many journals have instituted reproducibility policies for submitting researchers to follow. Although a variety of journals have these policies, particularly in the Statistical and Data Sciences, very few actually go through the process of verifying that the standards are met. Authors, finding it to to be a complicated and challenging task, will often not take the necessary steps to make their work truly reproducible. And journals, given the amount of time and money required to verify submissions' reproducibility, will often give submitting authors the benefit of the doubt in assuming that their work is reproducibile as long as some code and/or data has been provided. This results in the publishing of many articles that claim to be reproducible in theory, but do not meet such standards when tested in practice.

`fertile` could provide significant assistance with this process. Journals could integrate `fertile` into their article review workflow, running the primary checks in the package to see whether they are passed or if they fail. This would be an incredibly fast process: as long as a journal required that all submissions in `R` be in the `R Project` format, one reviewer could load the submission, run `fertile`, and receive a summary of the submission's reproducibility in a matter of minutes. 

Journals could easily build a standard of reproducibility around `fertile`'s checking system, requiring that a minimum set of checks be passed for any submitted article to be approved. This would improve the quality of submitted work and reduce the burden on journals of ensuring reproducibility in their published articles. Since `fertile` is publicly available, users would have access to the exact same testing system as any journal and therefore be able to ensure before submission that their articles would meet the provided standards.

```


This process would be much faster than that employed currently at the American Journal of Political Science, which goes through a thorough, multi-week-long reproducibility confirmation procedure for all submitted articles. Submitting researchers would know exactly which goals they were trying to achieve. They could download `fertile` on their own, run it on their project, check to see if their goals are met, and take the recommended steps to address failures if not. Then, upon submission, the journal would only need to run `fertile`'s functions once to confirm that the standards were met. 

Although this would only address a small aspect of reproducibility--that involving data analysis projects written in R--it would provide a significant time- and money-saving impact for both authors and reviewers in that domain.


### For Teaching Reproducibility

`fertile` could also be integrated into Statistical and Data Sciences coursework in order to educate students on topics of reproducibility. 

Many of the existing programs to teach reproducibility are courses focused on replication studies, where students must take a published paper and replicate the steps within completely. This process, which includes requesting the necessary data and code files from the original author(s) and sometimes even expanding the existing analysis further, often requires that participants have knowledge of data analysis and the scientific research process to be successful. As a result, such courses focused on reproducibility tend to exist only at the graduate level.

Undergraduate students, therefore, do not get exposed to reproducibility very often. There are a few exceptions--for instance, introductory courses at Smith College and Duke University that integrate RMarkdown to promote reproducible workflows--but overall, reproducibility is not covered in data science courses the undergraduate level.

`fertile` could help change this, allowing for many more colleges and universities to integrate reproducibility into their courses. The barriers to entry for using and benefitting from the package are very low, requiring only that participating students have:

* R and RStudio installed on their computer
* Knowledge of how to install a package from GitHub and load it into their environment
* Knowledge of how to create an R project
* Knowledge of how to run basic functions and input simple file paths

Though the process may entail some confusion and troubleshooting at first, even those brand new to `R` could succeed in overcoming these barriers in only a few days of class. As a result, `fertile` could provide professors with an opportunity to teach reproducibility concepts in introductory level courses. 

`fertile` could easily integrate into coursework in a similar way to how RMarkdown was integrated at Smith College and Duke University. While there is not only one way to utilize the software in class, a potential use of `fertile` could look as follows:

At the beginning of their courses, the professor provides their students with a brief introduction to reproducibility, including its importance and a basic description of how it is achieved. Shortly after, they introduce R Projects and the `fertile` package, explaining that they are tools to help with reproducibility. Then, they institute a requirement for all submitted homework assignments in the course: students must create and submit their work in the R Project format, but prior to submission must run `fertile` on their project to ensure that it passes reproducibility standards. When reproducibility errors inevitably occur, they can be used as teaching moments: the professor can share the error, explain why it happened, walk through `fertile`'s response to it, and interactively work with students to illustrate how it can be fixed.

The integration of `fertile` in this way would be an excellent method to introduce students to reproducibility concepts early on in their data science education, but at a low cost to the professor. 

Students would learn about reproducibility at the beginning of their data science education, which provides a variety of benefits over being introduced later on--in graduate school or through independent research on the topic:

* Teaching reproducibility early on gives students important research tools and understanding before they conduct any of their own important analysis.

* Practicing before students are believed to be skilled and highly educated in data science gives them an opportunity to fail and learn without fear of judgement.

* Integrating concepts early helps ingrain them in the minds of students, ensuring that reproducibility begins to come naturally to them.

These students would then be prepared for entering the research world and contributing to data science work in a transparent and reproducible way. 



** INTRODUCE EXPERIMENT HERE **

`fertile` is designed to: 1) be simple enough that users with minimal `R` experience can use the package without issue, 2) increase the reproducibility of work produced by its users, and 3) educate its users on why their work is or is not reproducible and provide guidance on how to address any problems.

To test `fertile`'s effectiveness, we began an initial randomized control trial of the package on an introductory undergraduate data science course at Smith College in Spring 2020 **ADD FOOTNOTE** (This study was approved by Smith College IRB, Protocol #19-032).

The experiment was structured as follows:


1.Students are given a form at the start of the semester asking whether they consent to participate in a study on data science education. In order to successfully consent, they must provide their system username, collected through the command `Sys.getenv("LOGNAME")`. To maintain privacy the results are then transformed into a hexadecimal string via the `md5()` hashing function. 

2. These hexadecimal strings are then randomly assigned into equally sized groups, one experimental group that receives the features of `fertile` and one group that receives a control.

3. The students are then asked to download a package called `sds192` (the course number and prefix), which was created for the purpose of this trial. It leverages an `.onAttach()` function to scan the `R` environment and collect the username of the user who is loading the package and run it through the same hashing algorithm as used previously. It then identifies whether that user belongs to the experimental or the control group. Depending on the group they are in, they receive a different version of the package.

4. The experimental group receives the basic `sds192` package, which consists of some data sets and `R` Markdown templates necessary for completing homework assignments and projects in the class, but also has `fertile` installed and loaded silently in the background. The package's proactive features are enabled, and therefore users will receive warning messages when they use absolute or non-portable paths or attempt to change their working directory. The control group receives only the basic `sds192` package, including its data sets and `R` Markdown templates. All students from both groups then use their version of the package throughout the semester on a variety of projects.

5. Both groups are given a short quiz on different components of reproducibility that are intended to be taught by `fertile` at both the beginning and end of the semester. Their scores are then compared to see whether one group learned more than the other group or whether their scores were essentially equivalent. Additionally, for every homework assignment submitted, the professor takes note of whether or not the project compiles successfully.


Based on the results, we hope to determine whether `fertile` was successful at achieving its intended goals. A lack of notable difference between the *experimental* and *control* groups in terms of the number of code-related questions asked throughout the semester would indicate that `fertile` achieved its goal of simplicity. A higher average for the *experimental* group in terms of the number of homework assignments that compiled successfully would indicate that `fertile` was successful in increasing reproducibility. A greater increase over the semester in the reproducibility quiz scores for students in the *experimental* group compared with the *control* group would indicate that `fertile` achieved its goal of educating users on reproducibility. Success according to these metrics would provide evidence showing `fertile`'s benefit as tool to help educators introduce reproducibility concepts in the classroom.


### In Other Areas

`fertile` can also provide benefits in other domains. Though not an exhausted list, some of the potential uses of the software are: 

* *Private Companies*: Data analysis-focused companies could require their employees to use `fertile` to check the reproducibility of their projects before presenting them to clients. This would help such companies ensure that clients could trust the results that were being produced. 

* *Conferences*: Similar to academic journals, conferences promoting open research could require that papers written in `R` pass a `fertile` check as a condition for acceptance. Even if there were an exception given for those using confidential/identifiable data, this would likely increase the overall reproducibility of conference papers significantly.

* *Informal Data Analysis*: A lot of content in the `R` community is created purely for fun and interest. Outside of work, many `R` users will create data visualizations or analyses for their own private blogs or their twitter. Sometimes, users will also participate in community events like Tidy Tuesday, a weekly social project where a data set is posted and users are asked to analyze it and create a visualization of their choice. Many people use these informal analyses as an opportunity for learning and discussion, often sharing them on social media to try and get feedback on their work. Ensuring that the work is reproducible would facilitate this process. Users could run their project files through `fertile` to check that they are reproducible and post a link to download them. This would then allow others to run the code on their own to understand how it works and more easily be able to make suggestions as to how to improve it!  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

```

`fertile` is incredibly versatile in its applicability. It can be used anywhere from informal data analysis projects to academic journal review.
