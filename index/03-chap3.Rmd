# Incorporating `fertile` Into The Greater Data Science Community {#applications}

Finding a solution to addressing reproducibility on a widespread scale is a challenging problem. Attempts to do so--in academic publishing, software, and data science education--have made some progress, but many solutions have significant flaws. Primarily, they either:

A) Only address one small aspect of reproducibility--for example, software that focuses on version control or a set of journal guidelines requesting only that code and data be provided, but giving no further detail. 

\begin{center}
OR
\end{center}

B) Are challenging, time consuming, and/or burdensome to implement--for example, extensive journal guidelines, complex software packages with confusing functions, or academic courses on reproducibility that are only accessible to masters' students and take time away from other topics.

`fertile` is an attempt to address reproducibility in a way that does not fall victim to either of these challenges. Rather than focus on one area of expertise, `fertile` contains features focused on each of the six major components of reproducibility. Its self-contained nature allows users to address all aspects of reproducibility in one package; users can achieve near- or complete reproducibility with just a single piece of software. 

`fertile` also makes the processes of both achieving *and* checking reproducibility simple and fast. Those looking to check whether a project is reproducible can almost instantaneously receive a full report of where the project succeeds and where it fails, and those looking to improve their reproducibility can receive and act on `fertile`'s clear suggestions with minimal effort. Some of the package's features are enabled automatically and most others can be accessed with only a handful of functions, all of which are very simple in function. 

Additionally, `fertile` does not just provide a report on reproducibility and leave it at that. Instead, it attempts to teach its users the concepts of reproducibility in the same way that reproducibility-focused classes are meant to do. Users receive instant feedback when making mistakes and, when checking work after writing it, receive reports clearly indicating where issues were found, why they occurred, and how to correct them. 

It is also highly customizable, allowing users to utilize the tool in the way that fits their needs best. Those who want to focus their reproducibility checking in a certain direction have that option and those who want widespread overviews can also have their needs meet. Users who are interested in going beyond the base functionality of `proj_analyze` and `proj_check` also have additional functions at their disposal that they can use to check reproducibility, file paths, file types, etc.

## Potential Applications of `fertile`

These features make `fertile` an excellent tool for addressing the issue of scientific reproducibility on a widespread scale. `fertile` can provide a variety of benefits to users in all different application domains and with all different experiences. In this section, we consider the many potential uses of the package.

### In Journal Review

As discussed in Chapter 1, Academic journals have a significant reproducibility problem. In an attempt to address this, many journals have instituted reproducibility policies for submitting researchers to follow. Although a variety of journals have these policies, particularly in the Statistical and Data Sciences, very few actually go through the process of verifying that the standards are met. Authors, finding it to to be a complicated and challenging task, will often not take the necessary steps to make their work truly reproducible. And journals, given the amount of time and money required to verify submissions' reproducibility, will often give submitting authors the benefit of the doubt in assuming that their work is reproducibile as long as some code and/or data has been provided. This results in the publishing of many articles that claim to be reproducible in theory, but do not meet such standards when tested in practice.

`fertile` could provide significant assistance with this process. Journals could integrate `fertile` into their article review workflow, running the primary checks in the package to see whether they are passed or if they fail. This would be an incredibly fast process: as long as a journal required that all submissions in `R` be in the `R Project` format, one reviewer could load the submission, run `fertile`, and receive a summary of the submission's reproducibility in a matter of minutes. 

Journals could easily build a standard of reproducibility around `fertile`'s checking system, requiring that a minimum set of checks be passed for any submitted article to be approved. This would improve the quality of submitted work and reduce the burden on journals of ensuring reproducibility in their published articles. Since `fertile` is publicly available, users would have access to the exact same testing system as any journal and therefore be able to ensure before submission that their articles would meet the provided standards. 

This process would be much faster than that employed currently at the American Journal of Political Science, which goes through a thorough, multi-week-long reproducibility confirmation procedure for all submitted articles. Submitting researchers would know exactly which goals they were trying to achieve. They could download `fertile` on their own, run it on their project, check to see if their goals are met, and take the recommended steps to address failures if not. Then, upon submission, the journal would only need to run `fertile`'s functions once to confirm that the standards were met. 

Although this would only address a small aspect of reproducibility--that involving data analysis projects written in R--it would provide a significant time- and money-saving impact for both authors and reviewers in that domain.


### For Teaching Reproducibility

`fertile` could also be integrated into Statistical and Data Sciences coursework in order to educate students on topics of reproducibility. 

Many of the existing programs to teach reproducibility are courses focused on replication studies, where students must take a published paper and replicate the steps within completely. This process, which includes requesting the necessary data and code files from the original author(s) and sometimes even expanding the existing analysis further, often requires that participants have knowledge of data analysis and the scientific research process to be successful. As a result, such courses focused on reproducibility tend to exist only at the graduate level.

Undergraduate students, therefore, do not get exposed to reproducibility very often. There are a few exceptions--for instance, introductory courses at Smith College and Duke University that integrate RMarkdown to promote reproducible workflows--but overall, reproducibility is not covered in data science courses the undergraduate level.

`fertile` could change this, allowing for many more colleges and universities to integrate reproducibility into their courses.

In order for `fertile` to successfully be integrated into a college course, the participating students must have the following:

* R and RStudio installed on their computer
* Knowledge of how to install a package from GitHub and load it
* Knowledge of how to create an R project
* Knowledge of how to run basic functions and input simple file paths

These are relatively basic skills that can be taught to students within the first week or two of their introduction to `R`.
